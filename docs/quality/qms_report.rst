Quality Report
==============

.. document:: Quality Report
   :id: doc__score_qms_report
   :status: draft
   :version: 1
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: YES
   :realizes: wp__qms_report[version==1]
   :tags:


This document implements :need:`wp__qms_report` and based on the :need:`wp__qms_plan`. It summarizes
the results of the quality related activities. It shall be referred in the :need:`wp__platform_sw_release_note`
of a platform release.

The Quality Report contains:

1. Quality Overview
===================

The goal of this first version of the Quality Report is to provide an overview of the quality related activities
and their results. The Quality Report is a living document and will be updated at least with every platform release.
More important for the moment is to identify gaps and to close them.

1.1. Quality Objectives and Goals

Work Product Quality Goals
--------------------------

For all generated work products, the following quality goals are defined:

      - **Quality Criteria**
      - **Source**
      - **Target value**
      - **Allowed variation**
      - **Metric**
    * - 1
      - All work products have to be available and valid. Templates, checklists, and guidelines shall be used. Plans have to be up to date. The training material shall be available in the training path. The issues in the issue tracking system following the planning strategy.
      - All Repositories that contain work products and that are in development or maintenance phase
      - 100%
      - There is no allowed variation for the work products
      - The metric for the work products is ensured by the process that contains the work product. Only valid work products can be merged. Reviews are required and therefore checklists are prepared. If applicable, script based checks are implemented.

Evaluation Quality Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Processes are partially applied. So it's proved that they are applicable with some open gaps regarding implementation and
verification which are not final proved for the moment. The quality objectives and goals has to be archieved for the complete
project.
