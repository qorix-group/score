Symbol Report and Blanket Verification Report
=============================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Symbol report and blanket are tools for post-processing of code coverage data generated by Rust compiler.
They are used to calculate code coverage based on the raw data generated by Rust compiler and provide a report
with calculated coverage.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (Rust)
| Outputs: Report with calculated coverage

  Symbol report and blanket overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: >= 1.90.0 [1]_
- Official repository: https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene/tree/main/ferrocene/tools/blanket,  https://github.com/ferrocene/ferrocene/tree/main/ferrocene/tools/symbol-report
- Additional information for usage in other safety projects: https://public-docs.ferrocene.dev/main/certification/core/safety-plan/tools.html#code-coverage


Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| To add the Code coverage to your project or module follow guidelines in WIP

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Integrated in bazel.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires Rust toolchain and Bazel build environment.

Safety evaluation
-----------------
This section outlines the safety evaluation of symbol report and blanket for its use within the S-CORE project. This evaluation assumes that the Rust compiler is
qualified and output of coverage data in `.profraw` format is correct. Due to that, we solely focus on post processing that is done by symbol report and blanket only.

   * - Malfunction identification
     - Use case description
     - Malfunctions
     - Impact on safety?
     - Impact safety measures available?
     - Impact safety detection sufficient?
     - Further additional safety measure required?
     - Confidence (automatic calculation)

     - False-positive: The function is reported as covered and increase coverage percentage, although it is not covered in reality (not included in `profraw` data)
     - | The reported covarge number is reported higher than the real coverage.
       | This may lead to false assumption that code is sufficiently covered by tests, although it is not.

     - False-negative: The function is reported as not covered, although it is covered in reality (included in `profraw` data)
     - | The reported coverage number is reported lower than the real coverage.
       | This may lead to unnecessary additional testing effort (developer to prove it's covered or provide explanation), although code is already sufficiently covered.
     - no
     - no
     - yes
     - no
     - high
   * - 3
     - The function from source code is not included in the coverage report at all.
     - | The reported coverage number is reported higher than the real coverage.
       | This may lead to false assumption that code is sufficiently covered by tests, although it is not.
     - no
     - no
     - yes
     - no
     - high


Result
~~~~~~
Symbol report and blanket do not require qualification for use in safety-related software development according to ISO 26262.

.. [1] The tool version mentioned in this document is preliminary.
       Exact version shall be derived from qualified Rust compiler used in S-CORE project.
