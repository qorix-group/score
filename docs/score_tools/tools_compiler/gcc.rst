GCC Compiler Verification Report
================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is open-source C/C++ compiler. Used for both safety-related and non-safety-related software in the S-CORE project.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (C++), configuration files, dependencies
| Outputs: Object files, binaries, build logs

  GCC overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 12.x [1]_
- Official repository: https://gcc.gnu.org/
- Official documentation: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~
To use QCC in a project, add the appropriate toolchain configuration to the `MODULE.bazel` file.

.. code-block:: Python

  # Configure the gcc toolchain.
  bazel_dep(name = "score_toolchains_gcc", version = "0.5", dev_dependency = True)

  gcc = use_extension("@score_toolchains_gcc//extentions:gcc.bzl", "gcc", dev_dependency = True)
  gcc.toolchain(
    sha256 = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>",
    strip_prefix = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    url = "https://github.com/eclipse-score/<path_to_gcc>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc12.tar.gz",
  )
  use_repo(gcc, "gcc_toolchain", "gcc_toolchain_gcc")

If your project uses multiple toolchains or configurations, update the `.bazelrc` file in the project root to reference the QCC toolchain.

.. code-block:: Python

  ...
  common --extra_toolchains=@gcc_toolchain//:host_gcc_12
  ...

In this case default host toolchain is set to GCC and it will be used for all cc_* rules in the project.

Detailed instructions for setting up and tuning of GCC toolchain can be found in the S-CORE toolchains documentation, i.e. https://github.com/eclipse-score/toolchains_gcc

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
GCC is invoked by Bazel as the C/C++ compiler for host builds, unit tests and integration testing.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires Linux and Bazel build environment.

Result
------
GCC requires qualification for use in safety-related software development according to ISO 26262.


**Tool Qualification**
----------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GCC is an open-source tool and does not provide formal, vendor-defined requirements.
Therefore, the tooling team is responsible for qualification of GCC used for the the project.
The requirements for testing must be derived from tool version, configuration (compiler flags, etc.)
and environment.

.. [1] The tool version mentioned in this document is preliminary. It is subject to change and will be updated in future.
