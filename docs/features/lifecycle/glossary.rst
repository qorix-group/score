Lifecycle Glossary
==================

.. glossary::
    Lifecycle Feature
      Feature providing support for starting and stopping processes.

    Launch Manager
      Component to start and stop processes on a POSIX like operating system.

    Health Monitor
      Provides process local monitoring functionalities such as deadline monitoring
      and logical program flow monitoring.

    Control Interface
      Interface to control the lifecycle of the system, e.g. to start and stop processes.

    Alive Interface
      Interface to monitor the aliveness of a process.

    Sandbox
      A sandbox is a set of configurations, which are applied to a process when it
      is started. It can include environment variables, secpol policies, cgroup
      configurations, user and group IDs etc.

    Health Monitor Interface
      Interface to monitor the health of a process, e.g. to check if a process is
      alive or if it is running as expected.

    Alive Monitoring
      Checks if an application reports an alive state in a certain period.

    Deadline Monitoring
      Monitor to detect if a state was reached within a specified time related to
      another event.

    Logical Programflow Monitoring
      Monitor to detect if certain states were reached in a defined sequence and
      time interval.

    Run State
      An Run State defines a set of components, which are in status running
      and are supervised by the software platform. If the health management system
      detects abnormal situation it can change the :term:`Run State`.

    Component
      A configurable unit in the Launch Manager that describes an executable and its runtime environment (sandbox). Components can be grouped together in Run Targets to define system operational states.

    Ready State
      A state when the component is ready to provide services to other components.

    Dependency (between components)
      A configuration parameter indicating that **Component A** can only start
      after **Component B** has reached its :term:`Ready State`. In this case,
      **Component A** depends on **Component B**.

    Dependency (between run targets)
      A configuration parameter indicating that **Run Target A** includes all
      components from **Run Target B**. In this case, **Run Target A** depends
      on **Run Target B**.

    Lifecycle Component
      Node of the dependency tree.

    Process
      Instantiation of an Executable programs running on the system that are managed by the Launch Manager.

    Polling Interval
      The time interval between successive checks of a condition or status.

    Recovery Action
      Actions taken by the Launch Manager when a process fails or terminates abnormally.

    Ready Condition
      A configurable condition that must be satisfied before a component is considered ready and operational. Ready conditions can include file system checks, network availability, or custom application-specific signals.

      Ready conditions can either be reported by the component itself through the Lifecycle Interface or determined via external state monitoring. External state examples include: process started, file is available, socket was opened, or that the process finished successfully.

    Liveliness
      The status of a process, notified by periodic calls to :term:`Health Monitor Interface`, as per configuration.

    Monitoring of Processes
      The activity of observing and checking if a process is running or has been exited with an abnormal status.

    Watchdog
      A monitoring mechanism that detects system failures and can trigger recovery actions.

    Interval
      A period of time between events or measurements.

    SWC
      Software Components - modular software units that can be independently managed.

    Run target
      A named collection of processes and their dependencies that can be launched, stopped, or switched as a group to achieve a specific operational mode or configuration.
