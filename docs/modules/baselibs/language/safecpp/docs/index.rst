Abstract
========

SafeCPP is a collection of utilities that helps developers write safer C++ code.

Motivation and Rationale
========================

The C++ standard library targets general-purpose software and often lacks the stricter semantics needed in safety-critical code. SafeCPP fills these gaps with small, opt-in utilities that make failure modes explicit and are easy to adopt incrementally.

Following components are provided by SafeCPP:

- **aborts_upon_exception**: Globally replaces C++ exception handling with ``std::abort()`` calls for safety compliance.
- **coverage_termination_handler**: Ensures coverage data is preserved in GoogleTest death tests.
- **safe_atomics**: Prevents overflow when adding numbers to atomic variables (thread-safe addition with `TryAtomicAdd`).
- **safe_math**: Provides overflow-safe arithmetic operations for integral and floating-point types.
- **scoped_function**: Offers controlled callable execution with explicit lifetime guarantees.
- **string_view**: Provides null-terminated string view types and safety utilities for secure string handling.
