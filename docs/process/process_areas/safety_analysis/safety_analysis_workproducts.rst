.. workproduct:: Feature Safety Analysis
   :id: wp__feature_safety_analysis
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_851, std_wp__iso26262__software_752, std_wp__isopas8926__4524

   Bottom-Up Safety Analysis with e.g. FMEA method, verifies the feature architecture (as part of SW Safety Concept)
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Feature Requirements or Assumptions of Use

.. workproduct:: Feature DFA
   :id: wp__feature_dfa
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_751, std_wp__iso26262__software_753, std_wp__isopas8926__4524

   Dependent Failure Analysis on platform/feature level
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Feature Requirements or Assumptions of Use
   Perform analysis on interactions between safety related and non-safety related modules or modules with different ASIL of one feature. Including potential influences from the rest of the SW platform.

.. workproduct:: Component Safety Analysis
   :id: wp__sw_component_safety_analysis
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_851, std_wp__iso26262__software_752, std_wp__isopas8926__4524

   Bottom-Up Safety Analysis with e.g. FMEA method, verifies the component architecture (as part of SW Safety Concept)
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Component Requirements or Assumptions of Use

.. workproduct:: Component DFA
   :id: wp__sw_component_dfa
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__analysis_751, std_wp__iso26262__software_753, std_wp__isopas8926__4524

   Dependent Failure Analysis on component/module level
   - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Component Requirements or Assumptions of Use
   Perform analysis of safety related and non-safety related sub-elements or sub-elements with different ASIL.
   Perform analysis on interactions between safety related and non-safety related sub-components or sub-components with different ASIL of one component. Including potential influences from the other components in the component's module.
