Feature Flag
============

To activate this feature, use the following feature flag:

``experimental_lifecycle``


Abstract
========

The lifecycle feature provides a set of functionalities to manage the lifecycle of
components in the S-SCORE platform. The goal is to ensure that components can be
started, stopped, and monitored effectively, providing a robust framework for
managing the state of the system.

Motivation
==========

For every ECU, handling of startup, shutdown, and monitoring of components is crucial to ensure the system operates correctly and efficiently. Additionally, we need to provide the means to set the system in different Run States, such as normal operation, engineering/debug mode, flash mode etc.
started, stopped, and monitored effectively, providing a robust framework for managing the state of the system.

Rationale
=========

Main task of the lifecycle system is to start and stop :term:`Processes <Process>` depending on the overall state the user wants to achieve and the functional dependencies between the :term:`Processes <Process>`.

A :term:`Lifecycle Component` can be very simple like a single process or more complex like a set of processeswhich are started in a certain order and with certain dependencies between them or containers.

We call a state of the system a :term:`Run State`, which is defined via the :term:`Lifecycle Components <Lifecycle Component>` running on the system at a certain point in time.
A lifecycle component is a configuration unit, which describes the executable, which shall be executed and the :term:`sandbox` the platform has to provide to run this executable.

E.g. the :term:`sandbox` shall describe

- environment variables, which shall be set via the lifecycle system
- secpol policies on QNX, which shall be applied to the process
- cgroup configurations on Linux, which shall be applied to the process
- user and group IDs under which the process shall be started
- ...

Via the configuration we define a certain :term:`Run State` and add all the components, which are needed to realize this Run State as dependencies.


A second task of the lifecycle system is to supervise the aliveness of the :term:`Processes <Process>`,
which are started and to initiate appropriate actions in case of a failure, which might result in many cases in a change of the :term:`Run State`.

The Lifecycle feature addresses the following stakeholder requirements:

• :need:`stkh_req__execution_model__processes`: Comprehensive process lifecycle management including startup, shutdown, recovery, and cross-process synchronization of threads

• :need:`stkh_req__functional_req__file_based`: Modular configuration file support allowing changes without rebuilding software, enabling flexible system setup and module management

• :need:`stkh_req__dependability__safety_features`: Implementation of monitoring safety mechanisms

A second task of the lifecycle system is to supervise the aliveness of the processes, which are started and to initiate appropriate actions in case of a failure, which might result in many cases in a change of the operting mode.

Support of containers
---------------------

A :term:`Sandbox` can also be realized as a container, which is  a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
In the context of the S-SCORE platform, container can be used to encapsulate applications and their dependencies,
ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

Main task of the lifecycle system is to start and stop components with an OCI compliant runtime
environment `<https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec>`__ depending on the overall state the
user wants to achieve and the functional dependencies between the processes.

We call a runtime-state of the system an Run State, which is defined via the processes running on the system at a certain point in time.

Coming from the OCI Specification the operation modes is a superset of the OCI states

- Creating
- Created
- Running
- Stopped

The overall functionality of the feature can be split into 2 subfeatures, which are
closely coupled to each other:

* **Lifecycle Management**: This subfeature is responsible for the management of
  the lifecycle of a :term:`Lifecycle Component`,
  * Creating/Initializing :term:`Sandbox`
  * Starting and stopping :term:`Processes <Process>` via :term:`Run State` s

* **Health Monitoring**: Provides platform functionality to monitor certain health
  conditions of applications:

  * Alive Monitoring
  * Deadline Monitoring
  * Logical Programflow Monitoring

* **External Monitoring**: Provides a concept to integrate with a external monitoring facilities.


Architecture
============

The concept is based on 2 major components:

* **Launch Manager**: Responsible for starting and stopping components based on
  the defined Run States and alive supervision of the started components

* **Health Monitor**: Provides process local monitoring functionalities such as
  deadline monitoring and logical program flow monitoring
