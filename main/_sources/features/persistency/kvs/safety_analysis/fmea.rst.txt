Persistency FMEA

.. document:: FMEA
   :id: doc__persistency_fmea
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :tags: feature_persistency

   For the FMEA analysis where the fault models :need:`PROCESS_gd_guidl__fault_models` are used.
   The following fault models doesn't apply to the persistency feature:

   Fault models
      - MF_01_03: Message received too early: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed.
      - MF_01_04: message not received correctly by all recipients (different messages or messages partly lost): Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed.
      - MF_01_07: Message is unintended sent: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency. Feature developed fully deterministic, so no unintended messages are expected.
      - CO_01_01: Minimum constraint boundary is violated: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed.
      - CO_01_02: Maximum constraint boundary is violated: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed.
      - EX_01_01: Process calculates wrong result(s): Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed. The feature is developed fully deterministic, so no wrong results are expected caused by persistency
      - EX_01_02: Processing too slow: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency. The feature is developed fully deterministic, so no processing too slow is expected caused by persistency.
      - EX_01_03: Processing too fast: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed. The feature is developed fully deterministic, so no processing too fast is expected caused by persistency.
      - EX_01_04: Loss of execution: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed. The feature is developed fully deterministic, so no loss of execution is expected caused by persistency.
      - EX_01_05: Processing changes to arbitrary process: Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed.
      - EX_01_06: Processing is not complete (infinite loop): Failure initiator not applicable at persistency, so no mitigation is needed. The feature is developed fully deterministic, so no infinite loop is expected caused by persistency.

    Covered by MF_01_01 because the violation cause is the same.
