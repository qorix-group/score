   :status: valid

   A communication interface consists of a combination of any number of the following elements:

   - Event-Types
   - Methods
   - Signals

   :id: feat_req__ipc__event_type
   :reqtype: Functional
   :security: NO
   :safety: QM
   :satisfies: stkh_req__communication__inter_process,stkh_req__app_architectures__support_data
   :status: valid

   An event-type is part of a communication interface and has:

   - a name
   - a data type

   The producer can assign a value to it.
   Consumers can subscribe to value-changed events of the element or poll unseen, cached events.

.. feat_req:: Method
   :id: feat_req__ipc__method
   :reqtype: Functional
   :security: NO

   :status: valid

   A method is part of a communication interface and has:

   - a name
   - a specified application routine with a given set of parameters and a return type

   When a communication partner issues a call to the method with the required parameters:

   1. it shall invoke the application routine with the provided parameters, and
   2. return its result to the communication partner

   A method call shall be possible both synchronously and asynchronously.

.. feat_req:: Signal

   - a name

   A client can trigger the signal.
   The service instance offering the trigger can:

   - wait for the signal to be triggered
   - check if the signal was triggered

   Note: Signals can not transport data. They are meant to be fast synchronization mechanism with low setup cost.
   Thus, depending on the location of the communication partners primitives like Linux Signals or QNX Pulses or
   Hypervisor Signalling APIs may be chosen.
