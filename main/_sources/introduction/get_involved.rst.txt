How to get in contact with S-CORE
---------------------------------

If you want to get into contact with S-CORE, these are your primary entry points:

:Project Mailing List: score-dev@eclipse.org

:Architectural Discussion: `#score-project-channel-public <https://sdvworkinggroup.slack.com/archives/C083Z4VL90B>`__

| **General Information / Alignment regarding S-CORE as a basis for distributions & products:**
| Contact one of the project leads of S-CORE https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.score/who

The technical HOWTO regarding involvement into S-CORE is described here:
https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md

How to get involved into S-CORE
-------------------------------

The only way to influence S-CORE is TO CONTRIBUTE. Everybody can :ref:`contribute <contribute>` â€“ S-CORE is open.

Active Contributions to the S-CORE project are the basis for getting involved. The S-CORE Project works according to
the Eclipse Project Handbook and has named and elected project leads and committers (see https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.score/who).
Direction of the S-CORE project is discussed and decided in the project lead circle, technical direction is created and upfront in the tech
lead circle. Meeting notes are transparent via the S-CORE github organization. (see https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions)

We aim to build a safety ready full stack architecture, where components fit to each other in
automotive grade Software Quality and performance. To achieve this, we follow a strict
:ref:`feature roadmap and architecture <releases>`
and a :ref:`rigid software development process <process_description>`
(currently under development).

Contributions to the S-CORE project must therefore follow the technical direction of the project and the S-CORE
architecture. All work in S-CORE will therefore follow a
:need:`Contribution Request Guideline <gd_guidl__contr_request_guideline>`.
Features on the roadmap of S-CORE are defined, Contribution Requests create the basis for individual contributions from
within the S-CORE project and also from the outside.

You can make proposals for new features or architectural building blocks besides the active contribution requests.
Those will not by default be part of the next release of S-CORE, because the S-CORE release roadmap will strictly
comply with the contribution request structure.
We plan to have the initial contribution request structure available in the S-CORE GitHub until Q1 / 2025.

We plan to incorporate a staging area for such contributions, but
in the initial phase of the S-CORE project (until end of 2025) the focus will be primarily on building a valid 1.0
release. Feel free to reach out via the communication channels above.

If you think about your contribution to S-CORE, the `Feature Request overview <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/4/views/1>`_
is the best place to start.

Based on successful code contributions to the S-CORE roadmap, further steps in involvement (like becoming a committer)
will be handled according to the rules of the Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook.
We value real code based collaboration and will judge new potential contributors and committers mainly on the validity of their work.
Active and sustaining contributions are the basis for the ability to shape S-CORE.

Making active code contributions via the contribution request process described in the
:need:`Contribution Request Guideline <gd_guidl__contr_request_guideline>`.
