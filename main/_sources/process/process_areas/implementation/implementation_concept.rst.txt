Detailed Design
===============

In this step, the **components** are broken down into smaller, independent **units** that can be
**tested separately** during the unit testing phase.

Following the **Detailed Design Template** :need:`gd_temp__detailed_design`, we must document the
**design decisions** and **constraints** that guide the decomposition of the component into multiple
units. These decisions should be made based on the following ideas:

- **Design principles**
- **Design patterns**
- **Testability strategies**

The goal is to ensure that the decomposition supports **reusability** , **maintainability**,
**scalability**, **extensibility** and **ease of testing**.

The detailed design and implementation should follow an **iterative approach**, allowing for
continuous improvements in quality through multiple cycles of refinement.

Specification of Detailed Design
--------------------------------

A **unit** is a **granular, independent entity** of a component that can be **tested separately**
during the unit testing phase. Each unit represents a **self-contained functionality** and is
derived from the decomposition of a component.

**Draft: Characteristics of a Unit**

- **Independent** – Can be tested in isolation.
- **Granular** – Represents a small, well-defined part of the system.
- **Relational** – Has associations with other units, defined using **UML 2.0 notations** such as
  aggregation, composition, and generalization.

**Units in UML Diagrams**

- For **Rust development**, a **unit** is modeled using a **combination of `struct` and `trait`**,
  as Rust does not have traditional classes.


Static View
```````````
The **static view** represents the **units** and their relationships using **UML 2.0 notations**,
such as **aggregation, composition, and generalization**. This is depicted through
**UML structural diagrams**, including:

- **Class Diagrams** – Define **classes, attributes, methods, and relationships** (e.g., inheritance, associations, dependencies).
  Each **class** can be considered a **unit** in the design.
- **Rust Development Approach** – Instead of traditional classes, **Rust uses `struct` and `trait`
  combinations** to represent **units** in UML diagrams.

This view focuses **only on units and their relationships**.
Details such as **attributes and interfaces** are documented under the **Units within the Component section**
(refer to the template for details).

Dynamic View
````````````
The **dynamic view** illustrates how the **units** interact with each other to fulfill a specific
**use case** or **functionality**. This view captures the **behavioral aspects** of the component as it executes.
It is represented using **UML behavioral diagrams**, including:

- **Sequence Diagrams** – Depict the interactions between objects in a **time-ordered sequence**,
  highlighting how methods are invoked and how control flows between objects over time.
- **State Machine Diagrams** – Show how the **state of an object changes** in response to events,
  allowing for the modeling of complex state transitions.

These diagrams are essential for understanding the **dynamic behavior** of the component and how
units collaborate to perform tasks.

Units within the Component
--------------------------

For each unit it will have a id and the interfaces are shown in the interface view per unit.
The description of unit and its attributes can be seen in the code documentation.
For this we use the tracing to the documentation generated from the code comments.

We link the unit id to the comments in the code like -

For cpp using doxygen style comments-

.. code-block:: cpp

   /**
      * @rst
      * .. sw_unit:: cpp unit
      *    :id: sw_unit__<title>
      *    :security:
      *    :safety:
      *    :status
      *
      *    This implements the ....
      * @endrst
   */

for rust -

.. code-block:: rust

   //! .. sw_unit:: rust unit
   //!     :id: sw_unit__<title>
   //!     :security:
   //!     :safety:
   //!     :status
   //!
   //!     This implements the ....


Interface View
``````````````
For every unit, it should show the interface provided by that unit. For each unit and corresponding
interface, there shall be an implementation and documentation which is generated for the implementation
will have the units description and the interface. According the template the attributes shall be
filled and corresponding element is shown in the documentation generated form the implementation.

For cpp using doxygen comments-

.. code-block:: cpp

   /**
      * @rst
      * .. sw_unit_int:: cpp unit
      *    :id: sw_unit_int__<title>
      *    :security:
      *    :safety:
      *    :status
      *
      *    This implements the ....
      * @endrst
   */

For rust -

.. code-block:: rust

   //! .. sw_unit_int:: rust unit
   //!     :id: sw_unit_int__<title>
   //!     :security:
   //!     :safety:
   //!     :status
   //!
   //!     This implements the ....
