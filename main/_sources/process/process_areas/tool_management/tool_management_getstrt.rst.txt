In case you want to use a tool within **S-CORE** consider to:

* Check the tool list first: :ref:`platform_tool_list`. If the tool is already there and covers the intended use case, no further activity is needed
* Make yourself familiar with the development and supporting process descriptions in :ref:`process_description`
* Make yourself familiar with the relevant sections of the :ref:`Platform Management Plan <pmp>`, here especially with :need:`Tool Management Plan <doc__platform_tool_management_plan>`
* If the tool is not on the list or does not cover the intended uses cases, continue with creation of a Tool Verification Report according to :need:`wf__tool__create_tool_verification_report`
* In case of any questions, contact the :need:`Technical Lead <rl__technical_lead>`
