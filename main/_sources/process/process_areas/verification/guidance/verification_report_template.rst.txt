    This document implements :need:`wp__verification__module_ver_report`.

      | Place the document header here following the :need:`doc__documentation_mgt_plan`.
      |
      | This verification report is based on the :need:`wp__verification__plan`.
      | It covers all the components of the above stated module.
      |
      | Verification Report contains:
      |
      | **1. Verification Coverage**
      |
      | **1.1. on Requirements**
      | - Lists of component requirements (incl. AoU satisfied by the component) tested by which test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
      |   (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
      | - For external component Assumptions of Use: coverage by platform safety manual or feature/components incl. test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
      | - This is split in a list of QM requirements tested and a separate list of tests for ASIL rated requirements.
      | - List of component requirements (ASIL rated) linked to inspection checklist and verdict (derived from PR export)
      |
      | **1.2. on Architecture**
      | - List of component architecture tags tested by which test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
      |   (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
      | - This is split in a list of QM components tested and a separate list of tests for ASIL rated components.
      | - List of component architecture tags (ASIL rated) linked to inspection checklist and verdict (derived from PR export)
      |
      | **1.3. on Detailed Design**
      | - List of detailed design tags tested by which test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
      |   (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
      | - This is split in a list of QM components tested and a separate list of tests for ASIL rated components.
      | - List of detailed design tags (ASIL rated) linked to inspection checklist and verdict (derived from PR export)
      |
      | - The lists may also contain other verification methods like "Analysis" - process tbd
      |
      | **2. DFA Report**
      | - List of the performed component DFA, pass/fail with open mitigations
      |
      | **3. Safety Analysis Report**
      | - List of the performed component Safety Analysis, pass/fail with open mitigations
      |
      | **4. Unit Verification Coverage**
      |
      | **4.1. Structural Coverage**
      | - List of the units with C0(line) and C1(branch) coverage absolute and percentage
      |   (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
      | - List includes a column for the safety rating of each unit.
      |
      | **4.2. Static Code Analysis**
      | - List of the units with compiler warning numbers and coding rule violation numbers
      |   (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
      | - List includes a column for the safety rating of each unit.
      |
      | **4.3. Manual Code Inspection**
