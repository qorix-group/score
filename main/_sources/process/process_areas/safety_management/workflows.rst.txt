   | The Safety Manager in S-CORE is NOT responsible to provide the argument for the achievement of functional safety.
   | But the Safety Manager creates and maintains the safety package in the sense of a collection of safety related work products.
   | The generation and the maintainance of this draft safety package shall be automtated as much as possible.
   | It does not contain the final argumentation of the safety of the product.
   | As the safety package is only a collection of work products, the safety plan (template) can be used for documentation.
