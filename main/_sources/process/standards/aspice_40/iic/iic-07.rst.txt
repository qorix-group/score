   Process metric may have the following characteristics:

   - Measurements about the process' performance:
       - ability to produce sufficient work products
       - adherence to the process
       - time it takes to perform process
       - defects related to the process
   - Measures the impact of process change
   - Measures the efficiency of the process

.. std_req:: 07-05 Project metric
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-07-05
   :status: valid

   Project metric may have the following characteristics:

   - Monitors key processes and critical tasks, provides status information to the project on:

       - resource utilization against established plan
       - time schedule against established plan
       - process quality against quality expectations and/or criteria
       - product quality against quality expectations and/or criteria
       - highlight product performance problems, trends
   - Measures the results of project activities:
       - tasks are performed on schedule
       - product's development is within the resource commitments allocated
   - References any goals established

.. std_req:: 07-06 Quality metric
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-07-06
