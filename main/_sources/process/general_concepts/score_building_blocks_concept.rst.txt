Building blocks concept
-----------------------


Building blocks meta model
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following figure gives an overview about the building blocks of the **S-CORE** platform.
The objectives of the **S-CORE** integration platform are expressed as stakeholder requirements.
These objectives are further detailed and structured in features. Features are described
as a set of feature requirements with a corresponding feature architecture. The feature
requirements satisfies the stakeholder requirements. The technical implementation of a feature
is based on components, which are built-up by units, the lowest element in our model.
Components are described by component requirements, a component architecture and a detailed
design.
Software modules are used to encapsulate a set of components. Software modules are more or less
container for a component or a set of components realizing a feature.

Building blocks example
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The following figure is an example to explain the elements from the meta model. The user of the
**S-CORE** platform wants to use the feature key-value-store. For that the user must integrate
the software module "kvstorage". As this modules dependence on another module, the user must also
integrate the software module "json_al". The module "kvstorage" is built-up by the
components "kvs" and "fs", where the module "json_al" contains only one component "json_al".
The latter example is more or less a corner case.
Components may optionally built-up by other components. Software modules may also be designed
as safety element out of context (SEooC).
