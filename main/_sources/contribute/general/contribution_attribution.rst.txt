Actions to Ensure Proper Contribution Attribution in Eclipse SCORE
=====================================================================

To ensure that contributions are correctly attributed to organizations in the **Eclipse SCORE** project, follow these steps:

Actions for Contributors
--------------------------

1. **Create an Eclipse Foundation Account**
   - If you don't have one, register at `Eclipse Foundation <https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register>`_.
   - While it's a private account, please use your corporate email account (the one you will be using for commits). In case of change of employment there is a dedicated process for it.

2. **Link Your Account to Your Employer**
   - Ensure that your **employer information** is set to a valid **Eclipse Foundation Member Company**.
   - This can be done in the **Eclipse Foundation account settings**.

3. **Use Your Corporate Email for Commits**
   - Configure Git to use your corporate email associated with your Eclipse account::

       git config --global user.email "your_corporate_email@yourcompany.com"

   - Verify that the email is added and confirmed in **GitHub account settings**.

4. **Avoid Using Different Credentials for Commits**
   - If you've already committed using a different email, update your Git settings and **ensure future commits** match your Eclipse Foundation email.



Actions for Employers
----------------------

1. **Ensure Employees Have an Eclipse Foundation Account**
   - Encourage employees to **register and link their employer** to their account.
   - If the employer account is **unclear** (e.g. due to subsidiaries), establish clear guidelines for employees on which account to use.

2. **Verify Membership Information in the Portal**
   - **Member representatives** can check and update the list of employees through the `Eclipse Membership Portal <https://www.eclipse.org/membership/>`_.

3. **Assist Employees in Aligning Emails**
   - If an employee has used an alternative email, **help them update their account** to include the relevant email address.



Expected Outcome
-----------------

- The **Organization Contribution Activity** chart will accurately reflect contributions from your company.
- **Member companies** will get proper recognition for their contributions.
- The **chart updates overnight**, so changes will be reflected the next day.

ðŸ”¹ **Note:** The **chart only displays contributions** from **Eclipse Foundation member companies**.
Contributions from individuals not associated with a member company will be listed under **"Contributor"**.

By following these steps, we can **ensure accurate reporting and better visibility** for organizational contributions.
