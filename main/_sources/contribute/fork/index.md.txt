# Enterprise Forking Guide for S-CORE Repositories

## 1. Purpose & Context

This guide helps companies (tool vendors, integrators, OEMs, suppliers) decide how to structure forks of S-CORE repositories to:

- Contribute efficiently upstream
- Integrate internal compliance & security workflows
- Keep proprietary or distribution-specific assets separate
- Avoid accidental leakage of secrets or internal IP
- Automate promotion of reviewed code to the public community

> S-CORE spans 50+ repositories. You don't need a one-size-fits-all approach — pick the minimal model per repository and evolve as needs grow.

### 1.1 Audience

Engineering organizations managing both internal and external code flows; platform/DevEx teams formalizing contribution and publication pipelines; compliance and security stakeholders.

### 1.2 Goals
Provide a decision and execution framework that reduces friction and risk while keeping the path to upstream contribution short.

### 1.3 Out of Scope
License interpretation, export control, internal HR / policy approvals. You must comply with S-CORE licensing independently.

### 1.4 Private vs Public Forks

Each model description focuses on WHEN to use it and inherent CONSTRAINTS. Implementation details are in Section 2.

#### Public Fork

- Use when: You only need to contribute upstream or maintain a long-lived divergence openly.
- Pros: Simple, no internal infra, no delays for daily work.
- Constraints: No internal-only code separation; risk of accidental leakage if you try to “hide” things manually. Review happens in public, which may not suit all contributions. All authors must be comfortable with public exposure.

#### Internal Fork

- Use when: You passively consume S-CORE (read-only) or maintain internal extensions not (yet) publishable.
- Pros: Freedom to experiment internally; shield proprietary assets.
- Constraints: Requires disciplined syncing from upstream to avoid drift. Requires internal infrastructure. No contributions possible.

Note that internal forks can use any infrastructure and do not need to be on GitHub.

#### Hybrid (Both)

- Use when: You both maintain internal-only additions AND contribute upstream regularly.

## 2. Implementing the Hybrid Approach

When organizations need both internal-only work and a path to upstream contribution, adopt a hybrid approach. Below each variant includes a short "use / pros / constraints" summary and recommended practices.

Depending on policy and compliance constraints, pick the simplest viable variant and document ownership for sync and publication tooling.

### 2.1 Public-first Workflow

All S-CORE targeting contributions happen directly on the public fork.

Recommendations

1. Short-lived feature branches (e.g., `topic` or `<username>/<topic>`)
2. Open an individual PR for each change upstream
3. Delete merged branches

Notes

- Your fork's `main` may either track upstream or remain unused.
- Use pre-commit checks to detect internal-only patterns before pushing.

Use when

- You primarily contribute upstream or maintain public divergences.

Pros

- Simple: little infrastructure needed and fewer delays for day-to-day work.

Constraints

- No built-in separation for internal-only code; manual hiding is error-prone.
- History and reviews are public; not suitable for all compliance/privacy needs.
- Potentially not suitable for large or sensitive contributions.

### 2.2 Internal-first Workflow

Development happens internally; publication to a public fork is an explicit, audited step. This is common where compliance, IP, or privacy constraints apply.

Common reasons

- Organizational policies requiring internal vetting before public exposure
- Need to shield proprietary assets
- Need to restrict author visibility

Workflow overview

Just an example, obviously adapt to your needs.

- Development in `internal/feature_unverified`
- Merge to `internal/feature_verified` after internal review
- Transfer to `public_fork/feature` (manual or automated transformation)
- Open PR to `eclipse-score/feature` (manual or automated)

Use when

- Your organization mandates internal control and vetting before any public push.

Pros

- Good for protecting IP and meeting regulatory/compliance requirements.

Constraints

- Requires internal infrastructure and operational processes to manage branches, reviews, and syncing.
- Demands disciplined synchronization from upstream to avoid painful drift and costly merges.
- Typically increases TTM (time-to-merge) for open contributions; may hinder collaborative workflows.

Note: internal forks do not need to live on GitHub; choose infrastructure that meets your needs.

### 2.3 Mixing Both Workflows

Some organizations choose a pragmatic mix: public-first for small changes, internal-first for large or sensitive changes.

Use when

- You need both, efficiency and internal-first workflows.

Pros

- Flexible: reduce friction for frequent contributions while protecting sensitive work. Lets you apply lightweight public workflows for small items and/or trusted contributors, and heavier internal processes for sensitive work. See when to use-sections in internal-first and public-first workflows for guidance.

Constraints

- Adds process complexity and requires clear tooling and ownership to avoid confusion and double-work.
- Requires careful documentation and automation to keep transformations, authorship, and history coherent across boundaries.



## 3. How To work with forks

First and foremost see [GitHub's guide to working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

Note that in enterprise environments forks will usually be created by forking into an company organization (e.g. `my_company/score`) rather than a personal account. And those will be created by infrastructure administrators rather than individual developers.

You can create such a fork e.g. via the GitHub CLI, [`gh repo fork eclipse-score/score`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork), or via an infrastructure-as-code process.

The default remote names will be:

- `origin`: your fork (e.g. `my_company/score`)
- `upstream`: the original repo (e.g. `eclipse-score/score`)

### Flow of a feature

There is a number of ways to achieve the same result in git, and it comes down to personal/team preference. Here is one possible approach.

```bash
# Update local main
git switch main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git switch -c <feature-branch>

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

Now you can create PRs from `<feature-branch>` to `upstream/main` directly. See [GitHub Docs - Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for details.
Alternatively you can use `gh pr create` to create PRs from the command line.


#### Opinionated Alternative: change main reference

If you prefer to keep your local `main` tracking upstream directly (and avoid maintaining `my_company/main`), set upstream as the branch's upstream and fast-forward when needed:

```bash
git switch main
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main
git reset --hard upstream/main
```

This makes daily flow trivial: `git pull` on `main` gives you the latest upstream state.

### Transformation / Filtering Pipeline (Copybara Implementation)

Adds controlled publication with filtering and metadata normalization.

#### Overview

[Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) synchronizes code between repositories and can:

- Mirror internal → public
- Filter files
- Transform content and metadata
- Preserve coherent history

#### Key Benefits

Iterative (non-squash) commits:

- Retain individual commits
- Preserve messages & timestamps
- Avoid history compression

File filtering:

- Exclude internal-only assets (e.g., `.github/workflows`, `copy.bara.sky`)
- Publish only OSS-relevant content

Author preservation:

```python
authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Qorix Bot <bot@qorix.dev>")
```

Preserves original commit authors for traceability.

Transformations:
Supports `core.replace`, `core.move`, `core.transform`, header injection, folder renames.

Example:

```python
transformations = [
  core.replace(
    before = "INTERNAL_PATH",
    after = "PUBLIC_PATH",
  )
]
```

#### Minimal Configuration Example

```python
origin = git.origin(
  url = "https://github.com/qorix-group/inc_orchestrator_internal.git",
  ref = "main",
)

destination = git.destination(
  url = "https://github.com/qorix-group/inc_orchestrator.git",
  fetch = "refs/heads/main",
  push = "refs/heads/{{BRANCH}}",
)

core.workflow(
  name = "publish_branch",
  mode = "ITERATIVE",
  origin = origin,
  origin_files = glob([
    "**",
  ], exclude=[
    "copy.bara.sky",
    "sync.sky",
    ".github/workflows/copybara.yml",
    ".github/workflows/sync.yml",
  ]),
  destination = destination,
  authoring = authoring.pass_thru("Qorix Bot <bot@qorix.dev>"),
  transformations = [],
)
```

#### CI Integration {#ci-integration}

Example CI steps to generate a GitHub App token, configure git, and run Copybara:

```yaml
- name: Generate GitHub App token
  id: generate_token
  uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v2
  with:
  app_id: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
  private_key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- name: Configure Git
  run: |
  git config --global user.name  "Qorix Bot"
  git config --global user.email "bot@qorix.dev"
  echo "https://x-access-token:${{ steps.generate_token.outputs.token }}@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials

- name: Run Copybara
  run: |
  sed -i "s/{{BRANCH}}/${{ github.event.inputs.branch_name }}/g" copy.bara.sky
  curl -LO https://github.com/qorix-group/copybara/releases/download/v20250508/copybara_deploy.jar
  java -jar copybara_deploy.jar migrate copy.bara.sky publish_branch
```

#### Local Usage

```bash
java -jar copybara_deploy.jar --init-history --force copy.bara.sky publish_branch
```

Use local runs to preview migrations or sync new branches outside CI.

#### Challenges & Trade-offs

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| No native GH default token support | Extra auth setup |
| Requires state for first branch push | One-time `--init-history` nuance |
| Credential & git config ceremony | Boilerplate in CI |
| Additional maintenance | Long-term ownership needed |

#### Summary

Copybara offers a controlled, scriptable way to synchronize repositories while filtering content and preserving authorship. Use it when manual workflows no longer scale or policy filtering is mandatory.

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Periodically update your fork's `main` from S-CORE `main` and run internal checks (tests, linting, compliance) before accepting changes. Neglecting regular syncs increases integration cost over time.

### Prefer GitHub Apps instead of (Fine Grained) Personal Access Tokens

Prefer GitHub Apps for automated CI access where possible; fine-grained PATs increase token-management overhead and invite accidental long-lived credential exposure.

TODO: add short examples and links to recommended app installation steps.
