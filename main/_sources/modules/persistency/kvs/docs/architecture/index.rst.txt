Rationale Behind Architecture Decomposition
*******************************************
mandatory: a motivation for the decomposition or reason for not further splitting it into sub components.

.. note:: Common decisions across components / cross cutting concepts is at the higher level.

Static Architecture
-------------------

The components are designed to cover the expectations from the feature architecture
(i.e. if already exists a definition it should be taken over and enriched).

.. comp_arc_sta:: Component Name (Static View)
   :id: comp_arc_sta__persistency__static_view
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: invalid
   :implements:
   :fulfils:
   :includes: comp_arc_sta__persistency__2

   .. needarch::
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

      {{ draw_component(need(), needs) }}

Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

   :id: comp_arc_dyn__persistency__dynamic_view
   :security: YES

Interfaces

      :security: <YES|NO>
      :safety: <QM|ASIL_B|ASIL_B>

Lower Level Components
----------------------

.. comp_arc_sta:: Component Name 2
   :id: comp_arc_sta__persistency__2
   :status: invalid
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: YES
   :implements:

   no architecture but detailed design

.. note::
   Architecture can be split into multiple files. At component level the public interfaces to be used by the user and tester to be shown.

.. attention::
    The above directives must be updated according to your component architecture.

    - Replace the example content by the real content (according to :need:`PROCESS_gd_guidl__arch__design`)
    - Set the status to valid and start the review/merge process
