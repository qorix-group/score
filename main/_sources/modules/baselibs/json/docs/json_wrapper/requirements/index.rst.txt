.. document:: JSON Wrapper Requirements
   :id: doc__json_wrapper_requirements
   :status: valid
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :realizes: PROCESS_wp__requirements_comp

Due to low complexity, the requirements of the JSON component were not split into the "sub" components
"JSON Wrapper" and "nlohman_json". Reasoning is the low number of requirements (only about ten).
The component split was done nevertheless, because "JSON Wrapper" is implemented as part of the S-CORE project and
"nlohman_json" is reused from open source.

So the requirements for "JSON Wrapper" are documented in :need:`doc__json_requirements`
(all requirements which are "fulfilled_by" :need:`comp_arc_sta__baselibs__json_wrapper`)
