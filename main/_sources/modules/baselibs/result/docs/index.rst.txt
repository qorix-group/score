Abstract
========

This component request proposes the integration of a safe Result library for type-safe error handling and value propagation.

Motivation and Rationale
========================

The Result library shall provide a type-safe mechanism to represent and propagate either a successful value or an error.
Result library will enable explicit error management and support the development of safety-critical features by providing clear value or error propagation paths.
A Result library with type-safe error handling is needed in the S-CORE software platform due to functional dependencies of different features and the need for explicit, reliable error propagation.
There are multiple use-case like logging error messages or comparing on expected error states to trigger other countermeasures.

Specification
=============

The following details and requirements describe the aspects of the current feature in the context of S-CORE.

General considerations
----------------------

The Result library should provide value/error propagation and error handling capabilities:

* :need:`comp_req__result__error_handling`
* :need:`comp_req__result__domain_error_information`
* :need:`comp_req__result__type_safety`
* :need:`comp_req__result__std_integration`
* :need:`comp_req__result__deterministic_behavior`
* :need:`comp_req__result__exception_free_operation`

The component should be extensible in the future to support richer error information and integration with other platform components.
