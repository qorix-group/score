That is, confirming assumptions of use\n  are actually consistent with the system and its Expected Behaviours by\n  intentionally misinterpreting or liberally interpreting them in a test\n  environment. For example, we could consider testing XYZ on different pieces of\n  hardware that satisfy its assumptions of use.\n\nRemember that a Misbehaviour is *anything* that could lead to a deviation from\nExpected Behaviour. The specific technologies in and applications of XYZ should\nalways be considered in addition to the guidance above.\n\n**Suggested evidence**\n\n- List of identified Misbehaviours\n- List of Expectations for mitigations addressing identified Misbehaviours\n- Risk analysis\n- Test analysis, including:\n    - False negative tests\n    - Exception handling tests\n    - Stress tests\n    - Soak tests\n\n**Confidence scoring**\n\nConfidence scoring for TA-MISBEHAVIOURS is based on confidence that\nidentification and coverage of misbehaviours by tests is complete when\nconsidered against the list of Expectations.\n\n**Checklist**\n\n- How has the list of misbehaviours varied over time?\n- How confident can we be that this list is comprehensive?\n- How well do the misbehaviours map to the expectations?\n- Could some participants have incentives to manipulate information?\n- Could there be whole categories of misbehaviours still undiscovered?\n- Can we identify misbehaviours that have been understood but not specified?\n- Can we identify some new misbehaviours, right now?\n- Is every misbehaviour represented by at least one fault induction test?\n- Are fault inductions used to demonstrate that tests which usually pass can\n  and do fail appropriately?\n- Are all the fault induction results actually collected?\n- Are the results evaluated?", "external_css": "external_link", "external_url": "https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description//main/trustable/assertions/assertions.html#assertion__trust__ta-misbehaviours", "id": "PROCESS_assertion__trust__ta-misbehaviours", "is_external": true, "layout": "score", "links_back": ["PROCESS_tenet__trust__tt-expectations"], "section_name": "Assertions", "sections": ["Assertions"], "status": "valid", "title": "TA-MISBEHAVIOURS", "type": "assertion", "type_name": "Assertion"}, "PROCESS_assertion__trust__ta-releases": {"content": "Construction of XYZ releases is fully repeatable and the results are fully\nreproducible, with any exceptions documented and justified.\n\n**Guidance**\n\nThis assertion is satisfied if the construction of a given iteration of XYZ is\nboth *repeatable*, demonstrating that all of the required inputs are controlled,\nand *reproducible*, demonstrating that the construction toolchain and build\nenvironment(s) are controlled (as described by TA-TESTS).\n\nThis assertion can be most effectively satisfied in a Continuous Integration\nenvironment with mirrored projects (see TA-SUPPLY_CHAIN), using build servers that have\nno internet access.

This check shall be supported by tooling.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_03\n     - Is the requirement description *atomic* ?\n     - A good way to think about this is to consider if the requirement may be tested by one (positive) test case or needs more of these. The sentence template should also avoid being non-atomic already. Note that there are cases where also non-atomic requirements are the better ones, for example if those are better understandable.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_04\n     - Is the requirement description *feasible* ?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection the requirement has already some implementation. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_impl` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. not implemented at least as \"proof-of-concept\"), a development expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_02_05\n     - Is the requirement description *independent from implementation* ?\n     - This checkpoint should improve requirements definition in the sense that the \"what\" is described and not the \"how\" - the latter should be described in architecture/design derived from the requirement. But there can also be a good reason for this, for example we would require using a file format like JSON and even specify the formatting standard already on stakeholder requirement level because we want to be compatible. A finding in this checkpoint does not mean there is a safety problem in the requirement.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_03_01\n     - For stakeholder requirements: Is the *rationale* correct?\n     - Rationales explain why the top level requirements were invented. Do those cover the requirement?\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_03_02\n     - For other requirements: Is the *linkage to the parent requirement* correct?\n     - Linkage to correct levels and ASIL attributes is checked automatically, but it needs checking if the child requirement implements (at least) a part of the parent requirement.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_04_01\n     - Is the requirement *internally and externally consistent*?\n     - Does the requirement contradict other requirements within the same or higher levels? One may restrict the search to the feature for component requirements, for features to other features using same components.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_05_01\n     - Do the software requirements consider *timing constraints of the parent requirement*?\n     - This bullet point encourages to think about timing constraints even if those are not explicitly mentioned in the parent requirement. If the reviewer of a requirement already knows or suspects that the implementation will be time consuming, one should think of the expectation of a \"user\".\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_06_01\n     - Does the Requirement consider *external interfaces*?\n     - The SW platform's external interfaces (to the user) are defined in the Feature Architecture, so the Feature and Component Requirements should determine the data consumed and set on these interfaces. Are output values completely defined?\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_07_01\n     - Is the *ASIL Attribute* set correctly?\n     - Derived requirements are checked automatically, see :need:`PROCESS_PROCESS_gd_req__req__linkage_safety`. But for the top level requirements this needs to be checked for correctness. Also AoU from external components need check for correct ASIL as those are the \"origin\" of safety requirements towards the SW platform.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_07_02\n     - Is the attribute *security* set correctly?\n     - Stakeholder requirements security attribute should be set based on Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) (process is TBD). Checklist item is supported by automated check: \"Every requirement which satisfies a requirement with security attribute set to YES inherits this\". Expectation is that the feature/component requirements/architecture may also be subject to a Software Security Criticality Analysis (process is TBD).\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_08_01\n     - Is the requirement *verifiable*?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection already tests are created for the requirement. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_test_covered` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. missing test cases), a test expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_09_01\n     - For stakeholder requirements: Do those cover assumed safety mechanisms needed by the hardware and system?\n     - Note that the feature/component requirements also cover safety mechanisms in case those are needed to mitigate failures found during :ref:`safety_analysis`\n     -\n     -\n     -\n   * - REQ_09_02\n     - For other requirements: Do the requirements defining a safety mechanism contain the error reaction leading to a safe state?\n     - Alternatively to the safe state there could also be \"repair\" mechanisms.

security management:**\n\nSecurity culture:\n\nSecurity culture is planned to grow in the SW platform.\nThis shall be fostered by doing a lessons learned after each feature development completion,\nusing the ISO SAE 21434 Annex B, Table B.1 as a questionnaire.\nThis lessons learned is the main input for process improvement managed by :need:`PROCESS_wp__process_impr_report`.\nAs starting point for security culture we define a Committer selection process to already have\nprofessionals with security experience in the teams. Additionally the SW platform's processes\nare defined with experience of several companies already performing successful safe and secure\nSW development. This also improves independence of reviews for the process definitions.\n\nQuality Management:\n\nASPICE standard is selected for quality management. Processes will always link to the\n:ref:`standard_isosae21434` standard and to the :ref:`standard_aspice_pam4` standard.\n\nCompetence management:\n\nThe :need:`PROCESS_rl__security_manager` on SW platform level is responsible to define a competence\nmanagement for the whole platform. Expectation is that the security competence of the persons\nnominated for the roles is already given and only has to be checked. The exception from this\nare the committers, for these no security competence needs to be enforced.\nSo the module security managers shall consult the :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_security_plan` and\nperform accordingly in their module project.\n\nCommunication:\n\nDevelopment teams are interdisciplinary, so the regular (sprint) planning and review meetings\nenable communication (as defined in :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`). Another main communication\nmeans are the Pull Request reviews. Also the standard Eclipse Foundation communication strategies\nare used (e.g. mailing lists)\n\nSecurity Weaknesses, Vulnerabilities:\n\nAs the SW platform organization does not have own vehicles in the field, it relies on feedback\nfrom OEMs and Distributors on bugs discovered in the field. The need for this feedback is part\nof each security manual. But also during development of change requests to existing features,\nbug reporting by the Open Source community or integration of existing SW components into new\nfeatures may lead to the discovery of new security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Security\nweaknesses and vulnerabilities can also be deviations from the development process with impact\non security. If these are known at the time of creation of a release they will be part of the\n:need:`PROCESS_wp__module_security_package` or :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_security_package` for the OoC.\nSecurity weaknesses and vulnerabilities relevant for already delivered releases will be\nidentified as such and communicated (as defined in Problem Resolution part of :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`)\nvia the :need:`PROCESS_wp__issue_track_system` (which is also Open Source).\n\n\n**Tailoring security activities:**\n\nMain tailoring driver is that the SW platform is pure SW development and is provided as \"(component) OoC\" -\nthis explains mainly the generic, platform wide tailoring.\nTailoring is done for the whole SW platform by defining only the relevant work products and an\nargumentation why the others are not needed in :ref:`standard_isosae21434` and :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_security_plan`.\nBut there may be also additional tailoring for each module/component OoC development to restrict further\nthe work products. This is documented in every module security plan. Here the usage of already\nexisting components is the main tailoring driver.\n\n\n**Planning security activities:**\n\nIn the security plan the nomination of the security manager and the technical/module lead is documented.\nThe planning of security activities is done using issues in the :need:`PROCESS_wp__issue_track_system`\nas specified in the :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`.\n\nIt contains for each issue\n\n* objective - as part of the issue description\n* dependencies on other activities or information - by links to the respective issues\n* responsible person for the activity - as issue assignee\n* required resources for the activity - by selecting a team label (or \"project\") pointing to a team of committers dedicated to the issue resolution\n* duration in time, including start and end point - by selecting a milestone\n* UID of the resulting work products - stated in the issue title\n\nThe planning of security activities is divided into the\n\n* Platform OoC planning, dealing with all work products needed only once for the platform. This is included in :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_security_plan`\n* Module/Component OoC planning, dealing with all work products needed for each module development (initiated by a change request), included in :need:`PROCESS_wp__module_security_plan`.\n\nA template exists to guide this: :need:`PROCESS_gd_temp__module_security_plan`.\n\n\n**Planning supporting processes:**\n\nSupporting processes (Requirements Management, Configuration Management, Change Management,\nDocumentation Management, Tool Management) are planned within the :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`\n\n**Planning integration and verification:**\n\nIntegration on the target hardware is not done in the scope of the SW platform project, but SW/SW\nintegration up to the feature level is performed and its test results are part of the\n:need:`PROCESS_wp__verification__platform_ver_report`.\nThe integration on the target hardware done by the distributor or OEM is supported by delivering\na set of HW/SW integration tests which were already run successfully on a reference HW platform.\n\nThis is planned by the respective work products:\n\n* :need:`PROCESS_wp__verification__feat_int_test`\n* :need:`PROCESS_wp__verification__platform_test`\n\nVerification planning is documented in :need:`PROCESS_wp__verification__plan`\n\n\n**Scheduling of reviews, audit and assessment:**\n\nScheduling is done in the same way as for all work products definition by issues.\nThe respective work products are :need:`PROCESS_PROCESS_wp__fdr_reports_security` and  :need:`PROCESS_PROCESS_wp__audit_report_security`\n\n\n**Planning of security analyses:**\n\nIn cases where the components consist of sub-components there will be more than one architecture\nlevel. Security analysis will then be done on these multiple levels.\n\nSee the respective work products:\n\n* feature level: :need:`PROCESS_wp__feature_security_analysis`\n* component level: :need:`PROCESS_wp__sw_component_security_analysis`\n\nAnalyses shall be based on `STRIDE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model>`_ model.\n\n**Provision of the confidence in the use of software tools:**\n\nTool Management planning is part of the :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`. The respective work product\nto be planned as an issue  of the generic security plan is the :need:`PROCESS_wp__tool_verification_report`,\nwhich contains tool evaluation and if applicable qualification of the SW platform toolchain.\nComponents developed in C++ and Rust will have different toolchains. Both will be qualified\nonce for the SW platform.\n\n**Provision of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Vulnerability Management**\n\nSBOMs provide a comprehensive inventory of all components and dependencies within a software\nproject, thus they can be interpreted as configuration information.\n`Eclipse Project Handbook: Software Bill of Material <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#sbom>`_\nrecommends to generate SBOMs and contains also information how to generate SBOMs.\nSBOMs are used as sources for collection of information and as trigger for further investigations\nas identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n\n`Eclipse Foundation Security Team <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-team>`_\nprovides help and advice to Eclipse projects on security issues and is the first point of\ncontact for handling security vulnerabilities. Nevertheless :need:`PROCESS_rl__contributor` and\n:need:`PROCESS_rl__committer` are responsible for following the `Eclipse Foundation Security Policy <https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/>`_.\nThe :need:`Security Team <PROCESS_rl__security_team>` is responsible for coordinating the resolution of\nvulnerabilities within the Project.", "external_css": "external_link", "external_url":

verification plan.\n     It should be adapted to the specific needs of project.\n\n\n     Purpose\n     =======\n\n     This section should briefly describe the overall goal of the verification plan.\n     It should state the plan's intended audience and the information it aims to provide.\n     This might include clarifying the scope of the verification activities and linking to\n     other relevant documents.\n\n\n     Objectives and Scope\n     ====================\n\n     Objectives\n     ----------\n\n     This section outlines the key objectives of the software verification effort.\n     Examples include correctness, completeness, reliability, performance, maintainability,\n     compliance, and traceability. Each objective should be clearly defined and measurable.\n\n     Verification Scope and Constraints\n     ----------------------------------\n\n     This section details what software components and functionalities are included in the\n     verification process. It should also clearly specify any limitations or exclusions.\n     This section should address external dependencies and integrations.\n\n\n     Risks and Mitigation\n     --------------------\n\n     This section identifies potential risks associated with the verification activities and outlines\n     strategies to mitigate those risks. This may involve referencing the :need:`PROCESS_wp__platform_mgmt`.\n\n\n     Schedules\n     ---------\n\n     This section defines the timeline for different verification activities.\n     It might include milestones, deadlines, and dependencies between tasks.\n\n\n     Approach\n     ========\n\n     General Approach\n     ----------------\n\n     This section provides a high-level overview of the verification strategy.\n     It should describe the overall methodology (e.g., Continuous Integration),\n     approaches used, and rationale behind the choices made.\n\n     Software Integration\n     --------------------\n\n     This section details how software components are integrated into the system.\n     It should describe the integration process, including procedures for handling new features,\n     bug fixes, and code changes.\n\n     Levels of Integration and Verification\n     --------------------------------------\n\n     This section defines the different levels of integration and verification that will be performed\n     (e.g., unit, component, system). Each level should be clearly defined, with associated criteria\n     for successful completion.\n\n     Verification Methods\n     --------------------\n\n     This section lists the specific verification methods used, such as static analysis,\n     dynamic testing, reviews, and inspections. Each method should be briefly described,\n     including its purpose and applicability at different levels of verification.\n     Reference tables can list methods, identifiers, applicable levels and ASIL relevance.\n\n     Test Derivation Methods\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n     This section details the techniques used to derive test cases (e.g., boundary value analysis,\n     equivalence partitioning, requirements tracing). It should clarify which techniques are used\n     at each level of testing and for different ASIL levels.  Again, a reference table is recommended.\n\n     Quality Criteria\n     ----------------\n\n     This section specifies the quality criteria that must be met for successful verification.\n     These criteria might include code coverage metrics, defect density, or other relevant measures.\n     The criteria should be defined with quantifiable goals for different ASIL levels.\n\n     Test Development\n     ----------------\n\n     This section describes the process for developing and maintaining test cases.\n     It should cover aspects such as test automation, test data management, and version control.\n\n     Pre-existing test cases\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n     This section describes how pre-existing test cases are handled which are e.g. available\n     from an OSS component. It should be stated how they are reviewed, integrated, extended\n     (e.g. with respective documentation), and adopted to the needs described in the project\n     (e.g. usage of documentation templates and traceability)\n\n     Test Execution and Result Analysis\n     ----------------------------------\n\n     This section describes how tests will be executed and the procedures for analyzing the results.\n     It should outline the tools and processes used for test execution and reporting.\n\n     Test Selection and Regression Testing\n     -------------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the approach to selecting test cases for execution and the strategy for\n     regression testing to ensure that new changes don't introduce regressions.\n\n     Work Products and Traceability\n     ------------------------------\n\n     This section lists all the key deliverables related to the verification process.\n     It should also describe how traceability between requirements, design, code, and test\n     cases is maintained.\n\n\n     Environments and Resources\n     ==========================\n\n     Roles\n     -----\n\n     This section defines the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the\n     verification process. It can refer and should be based on the definition in the\n     verification process :ref:`verification_roles`.\n\n     Tools\n     -----\n\n     This section lists the tools used for verification, including build systems, test frameworks,\n     static analysis tools, and other relevant software.\n\n     Verification Setups and Variants\n     --------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the different test environments and configurations used for verification.\n\n     Test Execution Environment and Reference Hardware\n     -------------------------------------------------\n\n     This section describes the hardware and software environments used for test execution.\n     It should include information about any specific hardware platforms or simulators used.\n     It should also define how the verification environment interacts with the CI system, including\n     access control and maintenance.", "external_css":

{"content": "**Purpose**\nThe purpose of this requirement inspection checklist is to collect the topics to be checked during requirements inspection.\n\n**Checklist**\n\n.. list-table:: Requirement Inspection Checklist Persistency KVS\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :widths: 10,30,50,6,6,8\n\n   * - Review ID\n     - Acceptance Criteria\n     - Guidance\n     - Passed\n     - Remarks\n     - Issue link\n   * - REQ_01_01\n     - Is the requirement sentence template used?\n     - see :need:`PROCESS_gd_temp__req__formulation`, this includes the use of \"shall\".\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_02_01\n     - Is the requirement description *comprehensible* ?\n     - If you think the requirement is hard to understand, comment here.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_02_02\n     - Is the requirement description *unambiguous* ?\n     - Especially search for \"weak words\" like \"about\", \"etc.\", \"relevant\" and others (see the internet documentation on this). This check shall be supported by tooling.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_02_03\n     - Is the requirement description *atomic* ?\n     - A good way to think about this is to consider if the requirement may be tested by one (positive) test case or needs more of these. The sentence template should also avoid being non-atomic already. Note that there are cases where also non-atomic requirements are the better ones, for example if those are better understandable.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_02_04\n     - Is the requirement description *feasible* ?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection the requirement has already some implementation. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_impl` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. not implemented at least as \"proof-of-concept\"), a development expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_02_05\n     - Is the requirement description *independent from implementation* ?\n     - This checkpoint should improve requirements definition in the sense that the \"what\" is described and not the \"how\" - the latter should be described in architecture/design derived from the requirement. But there can also be a good reason for this, for example we would require using a file format like JSON and even specify the formatting standard already on stakeholder requirement level because we want to be compatible. A finding in this checkpoint does not mean there is a safety problem in the requirement.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_03_01\n     - For stakeholder requirements: Is the *rationale* correct?\n     - Rationales explain why the top level requirements were invented. Do those cover the requirement?\n     - N/A\n     - No stakeholder requirements for Persistency KVS needed.\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_03_02\n     - For other requirements: Is the *linkage to the parent requirement* correct?\n     - Linkage to correct levels and ASIL attributes is checked automatically, but it needs checking if the child requirement implements (at least) a part of the parent requirement.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_04_01\n     - Is the requirement *internally and externally consistent*?\n     - Does the requirement contradict other requirements within the same or higher levels? One may restrict the search to the feature for component requirements, for features to other features using same components.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_05_01\n     - Do the software requirements consider *timing constraints of the parent requirement*?\n     - This bullet point encourages to think about timing constraints even if those are not explicitly mentioned in the parent requirement. If the reviewer of a requirement already knows or suspects that the implementation will be time consuming, one should think of the expectation of a \"user\".\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_06_01\n     - Does the Requirement consider *external interfaces*?\n     - The SW platform's external interfaces (to the user) are defined in the Feature Architecture, so the Feature and Component Requirements should determine the data consumed and set on these interfaces. Are output values completely defined?\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_07_01\n     - Is the *ASIL Attribute* set correctly?\n     - Derived requirements are checked automatically, see :need:`PROCESS_gd_req__req__linkage_safety`. But for the top level requirements this needs to be checked for correctness. Also AoU from external components need check for correct ASIL as those are the \"origin\" of safety requirements towards the SW platform.\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_07_02\n     - Is the attribute *security* set correctly?\n     - Stakeholder requirements security attribute should be set based on Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) (process is TBD). Checklist item is supported by automated check: \"Every requirement which satisfies a requirement with security attribute set to YES inherits this\". Expectation is that the feature/component requirements/architecture may also be subject to a Software Security Criticality Analysis (process is TBD).\n     - Yes\n     - No remarks\n     - https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/issues/960\n   * - REQ_08_01\n     - Is the requirement *verifiable*?\n     - Expectation is that at the time of the inspection already tests are created for the requirement. This can be checked via traces, but also :need:`PROCESS_gd_req__req__attr_test_covered` shows this. In case the requirement is not mature enough at the time of inspection (i.e. missing test cases), a test expert should be invited to the Pull-Request review to explicitly check this item.\n     -
