.. std_req:: 17-00 Requirement
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-17-00
   :status: valid

   Requirements may have the following characteristics:

   - An expectation of functions and capabilities (e.g., non-functional
     requirements), or one of its interfaces
   - from a black-box perspective
   - that is verifiable, does not imply a design or implementation decision, is
     unambiguous, and does not introduce contradictions to other
     requirements.
   - A requirements statement that implies, or represents, a design or
     implementation decision is called “Design Constraint”.
   - Examples for requirements aspects at the system level are thermal
     characteristics such as

     - heat dissipation
     - dimensions
     - weight
     - materials

   - Examples of aspects related to requirements about system interfaces
     are

     - connectors
     - cables
     - housing

   - Examples for requirements at the hardware level are

     - lifetime and mission profile, lifetime robustness
     - maximum price
     - storage and transportation requirements
     - functional behavior of analog or digital circuits and logic
     - quiescent current, voltage impulse responsiveness to crank, startstop, drop-out, load dump
     - temperature, maximum hardware heat dissipation
     - power consumption depending on the operating state such as
       sleep-mode, start-up, reset conditions
     - frequencies, modulation, signal delays, filters, control loops
     - power-up and power-down sequences, accuracy and precision of
       signal acquisition or signal processing time
     - computing resources such as memory space and CPU clock
       tolerances
     - maximum abrasive wear and shearing forces for e.g., pins or
       soldering joints
     - requirements resulting from lessons learned
     - safety related requirements derived from the technical safety
       concept

.. std_req:: 17-05 Requirements for work products
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-17-05
   :status: valid

   Requirements for work products may have the following characteristics:

   - Requirements for content and structure, storage and control
       - Identifies documentation specific meta data, such as id, date, author information, ownership, access rights, review and approval status with, where applicable, status model and workflow, or others
       - Identifies requirements on documentation structure, e.g., table of content or figures or other formal aspects
       - May be provided by documentation templates
       - May be based on tool specific templates
       - Defines the storage location such as data repository, tool, versioning system
       - Requirements for versioning
       - Requirements for baselining
       - Distribution of the documents
       - Maintenance and disposal of the documents
       - May be specific for certain types of documents

.. std_req:: 17-54 Requirement Attribute
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-17-54
   :status: valid

   Requirement Attributes may have the following characteristics:

   - Meta-attributes that support structuring and definition of release scopes
     of requirements.
   - Can be realized by means of tools.

   .. note::

      usage of requirements attributes may further support analysis of
      requirements.

.. std_req:: 17-55 Resource needs
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-17-55
   :status: valid

   Resource needs may have the following characteristics:

   - Identification of required resources for process performance
   - Staff including competencies, skills and authorities needs
   - Material, equipment, and infrastructure
   - Time and budget

   .. note::

    Needs are derived from Work Breakdown structure and schedule
