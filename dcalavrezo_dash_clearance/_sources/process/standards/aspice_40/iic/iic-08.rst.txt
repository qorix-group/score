   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-54
   :status: valid

   Feasibility analysis may have the following characteristics:

   - Statement about the ability of the project to achieve
     the project objectives with available resources

.. std_req:: 08-55 Risk measure
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-55
   :status: valid

   Risk measure may have the following characteristics:

   - Identifies
       - the risk to be mitigated, avoided, or shared (transferred)
       - the activities to mitigate, avoid, or share (transfer) the risk
       - the originator of the measure
       - criteria for successful implementation
       - criteria for cancellation of activities
       - frequency of monitoring
   - Risk treatment alternatives:
       - treatment option selected- avoid/reduce/transfer
       - alternative descriptions
       - recommended alternative(s)
       - justifications

.. std_req:: 08-56 Schedule
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-56
   :status: valid

   Schedule may have the following characteristics:

   - Identifies the activities to be performed
   - Identifies the expected, and actual, start and completion date for required activities against progress/completion of activities
   - Identifies dependencies between activities and critical path
   - Has a mapping to scheduled resources and input data
   - Identifies resource allocation, resource workload, and critical resources

   .. note::

      A schedule is consistent with the defined work packages, see 14-10

.. std_req:: 08-58 Verification Measure Selection Set
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-58
   :status: valid

   Verification Measure Selection Set may have the following characteristics:

   - Include criteria for re-verification in the case of changes (regression).
   - Identification of verification measures, also for regression testing.

.. std_req:: 08-60 Verification Measure
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-60
   :status: valid

   Verification Measure may have the following characteristics:

   - A verification measure can be a test case, a measurement, a
     calculation, a simulation, a review, an optical inspection, or an analysis
   - The specification of a verification measure includes

     - pass/fail criteria for verification measures (test completion and ending criteria)
     - a definition of entry and exit criteria for the verification measures, and abort and re-start criteria

   - Techniques (e.g., black-box and/or white-box-testing, equivalence
     classes and boundary values, fault injection for Functional Safety,
     penetration testing for Cybersecurity, back-to-back testing for model-based development, ICT)
   - Necessary verification environment & infrastructure
   - Necessary sequence or ordering

.. std_req:: 08-61 Resource allocation
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-08-61
   :status: valid

   Resource allocation may have the following characteristics:

   - Detailed / named resources are allocated to process tasks
   - Overall resource workload is considered (e.g., allocation of resources to multiple projects)

   .. note::

      Work breakdown structure may be used to refine the detailed resource allocation

   .. note::

      A resource allocation may be integrated in a/ be a part of the schedule, see 08-56

   .. note::

      Resources to be allocated are e.g., personnel/human resources for project roles and physical and material resources such as (special/limited) equipment, tool, licenses, test hardware, test vehicle, climate chambers etc.
