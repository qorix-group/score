.. std_req:: 03-06 Process performance information
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-03-06
   :status: valid

   Process performance information may have the following characteristics:

   - Measurements about defined quantitative or qualitative measurable indicators, that match defined information needs.
   - Measurement metrics for the calculation of the quantitatively or qualitatively measurable indicators
   - Data comparing process performance against expected levels
   - Examples for project performance information:
       - resource utilization against established target
       - time schedule against established target
       - activity or task completion criteria met
       - defined input and output work products available
       - process quality against quality expectations and/or criteria
       - product quality against quality expectations and/or criteria
       - highlight product performance issues, trends
   - Examples for service level performance information:
       - references any goals established
       - real time metrics related to aspects such as:
       - capacity
       - throughput
       - operational performance
       - operational service
       - service outage time
       - up time
       - job run time

.. std_req:: 03-50 Verification Measure Data
   :id: std_req__aspice_40__iic-03-50
   :status: valid

   Verification Measure Data may have the following characteristics:

   - Verification measure data are data recorded during the execution of a
      verification measure, e.g.:

      - for test cases: raw data, logs, traces, tool generated outputs
      - measurements: values
      - calculations: values
      - simulations: protocol
      - reviews such as optical inspections Ã  findings record
      - analyses: values
