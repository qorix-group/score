.. doc_getstrt:: Verification Get Started
   :id: doc_getstrt__verification__process
   :status: valid
   :tags: verification

   This document guides you through the initial steps of the software verification process,
   from creating test cases to executing and result reporting.
   It leverages the :need:`doc_concept__verification__process` and :need:`gd_guidl__verification_guide`.

Relevant Documents
******************

Key documents to get an understanding about verification activities are:

* **Concept Document:** :need:`doc_concept__verification__process` provides a high-level overview of the verification concept.
* **Verification Guideline:** :need:`gd_guidl__verification_guide` details test case development, execution, and reporting procedures.
* **Verification Plan:** :need:`wp__verification__plan` implementation outlines the overall verification strategy and objectives.
  (Note that the implementation of the verification plan can be found in the platform management plan.)


General Workflow
****************

The workflows can be split into 4 major parts:

* Test planning filling the template :need:`gd_temp__verification__plan`.
* Test specification and implementation for the respective testing level
* Test execution by the CI.
  (Manual test cases are treated as automated test with user interaction and timeouts.)
* Test reports are created when all verification artifacts on a module and platform level are
  available for a specific baseline.

The details of what needs to be done in each part are described in the :ref:`verification_workflows`.

Tooling Support
***************

The following tools support the verification process:

* **Bazel:** For building the software and running tests (supported by ITF).
* **Google Test:** For unit testing in C++.
* **Rust's built-in testing framework:** For unit testing in Rust.
* **Pytest:** For component to integration testing in Python.
* **ITF (Integration Test Framework):** As framework for integration testing based on pytest.
* **Sphinx-needs:** Tracing artifacts like requirements to test cases.

Additionally, tools will be provided to automatically generate coverage tests based on the unit source code.
