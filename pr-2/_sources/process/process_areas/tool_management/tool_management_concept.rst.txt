   :id: doc_concept__tool__process
   :status: valid
   :tags: tool_management

In this section a concept for the Tool Management will be discussed. Inputs for this concepts
are the requirements of ISO2 6262 Part-8, Clause 11, ASPICE PAM 4.0, SUP.8 and
ISO SAE 21434 Clause 5, 5.4.5 additionally including the requirements of the different stakeholders
for the Tool Management process.

Key concept
***********
In general all Tools to generate the S-CORE product must be identified. As it is a S-CORE objective
to use Tools wherever applicable to generate any kind of work products, the selection criteria for
any Tool including OSS Tools must include therefore the determination of the Tool Confidence Level
`(TCL) <https://www.validas.de/publications/automotive2012.pdf>`_ for the tool under consideration.

Based on the resulting TCL additional Tool Qualification activities may required.


Inputs
******

#. Stakeholders for the Tool Management?
#. Which documentations are required?
#. Which activities are required?

Stakeholders for the Tool Management
************************************

Standard Requirements
=====================

Also requirements of standards need to be taken into consideration:

* ISO 26262
* ASPICE
* ISO SAE 21434

Required documentation
**********************

For each tool the :need:`gd_temp__tool_management__verif_rpt_template` shall be used to document
the relevant information.

Activities for Tool Management
******************************

The main work product is the :need:`Tool Verification Report <wp__tool_verification_report>`.
Thus the workflow :need:`Create Tool Verification Report <wf__tool__create_tool_verification_report>`
applies.
