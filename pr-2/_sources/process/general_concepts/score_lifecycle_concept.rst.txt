Lifecylce concept
-----------------

Contributions to the **S-CORE** project are driven by Change Requests.

As features are the main structuring element of the platform, new features are requested by
a change request from type feature. The request may be supported by source code.
A new feature request happens in the **Concept Phase**.

During the **Development Phase** features are implemented and verified. The Development
is planned, checked and adjusted to meet the requirements. Planning is also required from
several standards especically to achieve functional safety.

Features are improved during the **Maintenance Phase**. In case bugs are found, they are also
fixed during this phase.
